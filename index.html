                <p>My name is Nevarre Sokolowski. I'm 34 years old,
                    and I come from a blue collar background in workshops and tree planting.
                    Don't let that fool you though, I'm a big nerd and easy to get along with.</p>
                <p>I'm competent on both the front and back ends of development, and I'm
                    happy doing whatever needs to be done. I enjoy building and fixing, getting
                    the job done and keeping everything on schedule.</p>
                <p>I enjoy working in C# and Object Oriented Programming in general. I'm proficient in ORM and
                    databases,
                    as well as Javascript and SQL. Visual Studio
                    has never let me down and is my preferred IDE, I've used Intellij as well.</p>
                <p> Immediate goals are to continue developing my technical skills, as there is always something
                    to learn. Further down the road, when given an opportunity, I believe I would excel in management.
                </p>
