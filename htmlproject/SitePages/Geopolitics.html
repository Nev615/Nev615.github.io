        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
          Egypt is located in the northeastern corner of Africa, extending
          into the southwestern part of Asia via the Sinai Peninsula. It acts
          as a transcontinental hub connecting the two continents, making it a
          strategic location for trade, politics, and cultural exchange.
        </p>
        <h3>Borders and Surrounding Countries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To the North</strong>: The Mediterranean Sea</li>
          <li>
            <strong>To the East</strong>: The Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba
          </li>
          <li><strong>To the West</strong>: Libya</li>
          <li><strong>To the South</strong>: Sudan</li>
          <li>
            <strong>To the Northeast</strong>: Israel and the Gaza Strip
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This geographical positioning gives Egypt control over key
          waterways, including the Suez Canalâ€”a critical maritime link between
          Europe and Asia.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Geopolitical Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Suez Canal</strong>: The canal is one of the world's most
            important waterways, allowing ships to bypass the longer route
            around the southern tip of Africa.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nile River</strong>: The Nile is central to Egypt's
            agriculture, water supply, and settlements. Its strategic
            significance extends beyond Egypt's borders, impacting neighboring
            countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Desert Landscapes</strong>: The Western Desert and Sinai
            Desert create natural barriers, influencing Egypt's defense
            strategies and regional relations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Proximity to Global Powers</h3>
        <p>
          Egypt's location places it within close range of Europe, the Middle
          East, and sub-Saharan Africa. This has made it a focal point in
          historical trade routes, colonial interests, and modern geopolitical
          strategies.
        </p>
        <h3>Strategic Implications</h3>
        <p>
          Egypt's location has shaped its foreign relations and security
          policies, making it a key player in Middle Eastern and African
          politics. Its neighbors and global powers often seek alliances or
          influence in the region due to Egypt's pivotal geographic position.
